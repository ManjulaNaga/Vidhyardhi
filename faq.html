<h3>How Long Does It Take To Create A Website?</h3>

<p>The length of time it takes to create a fully functional website is based on several factors. Custom design work can take anywhere from 1 - 4 weeks, depending on the complexity of the design and the number of revisions you require. The development phase requires an additional 1 - 6 weeks, depending on the number of pages, and the functionality required. Of course, these are general guidelines, and we will make every effort to meet the timeframe you have in mind.</p>

<h3>What Is The Average Cost For A Website?</h3>

<p>It is difficult to quote an average price, due to the enormous range in requirements for a site. According to BusinessWeek Online, a designer might charge $2,000 or more for a basic Web site, not including Web hosting fees. If you check out BuyerZone.com, you'll see that a 4 - 6 page template-based site will cost around $400, while a full custom design will come in closer to $800 - $1500. Other authoritative sources generally quote in the $1,000 - $2,000 range.</p>

There are many, many factors that influence the ultimate cost of any given website, and we encourage you to read our article regarding Website pricing for more information and guidance in searching for your Website provider.

<h3>How Much Do You Charge For Web Site Design?</h3>

<p>A fully customized, unique website design starts at $449, and page development is $50 - $75 each. Pricing for other services and functionality are outlined separately on our pricing page to help you determine and control the amount of your investment. We also provide our clients with a detailed estimate before any work begins.</p>

<h3>What Kind Of Technology Do You Support?</h3>

<p>We specialize in XHTML, CSS and Flash, but are very experienced with JavaScript, DHTML, XML, PHP, and others. Although it's unlikely, if there's something we can't do, we can reach out to our network of partners for additional services (at no additional cost to you).</p>

<h3>Can I See My Website While It's In Progress?</h3>

<p>Absolutely! In fact, we encourage it. We build your website on our development server, and provide you with a username and password so that you can log in and monitor the progress of your site. During this phase, we encourage your feedback if something isn't quite the way you envisioned it or if you've changed your mind. Once your site is ready and you have provided your approval, we release it live on your server and submit your URL to the major search engines.</p>

<h3>How Many Changes Can I Make To My Site Without Additional Cost?</h3>

<p>We give as much latitude as we possibly can. After you've identified the general format and color schemes of your preferred design, we'll complete up to 2 rounds of major revisions at no charge. All minor revisions are provided at no charge.</p>
