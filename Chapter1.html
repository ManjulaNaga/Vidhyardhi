<p>	What is HTML?
Since its inception HTML has been the predominant language of the World Wide Web. Indeed, no small part what made the World Wide Web "World Wide" was HTML. With the creation of HTML and the web browsers that interpreted it anyone with a computer and a phone line could surf the web *.
There are other languages (e.g. XML) used to write web pages, but most web sites are written in HTML and will be for the foreseeable future.
HTML is "spoken" by two computers:
1. Client
The client is used by the person surfing the net, such as the computer you are looking at right now.
2. Server
A server stores and distributes websites over the net. I have a server where I store this web site.
